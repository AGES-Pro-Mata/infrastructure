# PgBouncer User List - Pro-Mata Dev
# Format: "username" "password_hash"
# Since we're using auth_type = trust, password hashes are not required but kept for reference

# Main PostgreSQL superuser
"postgres" "trust_auth_no_password_needed"

# Main application user - will be populated with actual hash if switching to md5
"promata" "md5placeholder_will_be_replaced"

# Replication user - will be populated with actual hash if switching to md5
"replicator" "md5placeholder_will_be_replaced"

# Note: With auth_type = trust, passwords are ignored
# For production, switch to auth_type = md5 or scram-sha-256
