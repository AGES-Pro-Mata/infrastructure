# This file prevents Terraform validation in the backends directory
# The backends directory contains multiple backend configurations that should not be validated together
# Each backend configuration should be used individually in deployment directories

# Backend configurations are in:
# - dev-backend.tf (Azure Storage for development)  
# - staging-backend.tf (Azure Storage for staging)
# - prod-backend.tf (AWS S3 for production)

# Usage: Copy the appropriate backend config to your deployment directory
# Example: cp terraform/backends/dev-backend.tf terraform/deployments/dev/backend.tf
